# Sync - Collective Coherence Platform

A research-enabled group healing app that measures and visualizes physiological synchronization in real-time group chanting sessions. Chant together in harmony and experience the power of collective coherence.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript with WebSocket support
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL-based) for time-series data
- **Web App**: Next.js + React with real-time visualization
- **iOS App**: Swift with HealthKit integration
- **ML/Analytics**: Python for coherence calculation and data processing
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live session synchronization

## Getting Started

See individual README files in each directory for setup instructions.

## Research Focus

This platform is designed as a research instrument to study:
- Group physiological synchronization
- Collective coherence patterns
- Optimal group sizes and dynamics
- Network effects in meditation practice
